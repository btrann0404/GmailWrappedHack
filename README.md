  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>As full-time students, it gets frustrating opening up Gmail to hundreds of unread content every day – we can only imagine what Professors might receive on their end. Taking this into         account, we were driven to make accessing important emails easier and faster for all Gmail users. Taking inspiration from Spotify’s annual “Spotify Wrapped,” we got started on an     application that would “wrap” together these important emails.</p>
  <h2>Technolgies Used</h2>
  <p>Starting with Figma for design, we meticulously crafted a user interface that's not only visually appealing but also user-friendly, drawing inspiration from the sleek aesthetics of Spotify Wrapped. This ensured our ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and ChakraUI-powered front-end was both beautiful and functional, providing users with a seamless experience across devices.

On the back-end, Python and Flask handle API communications efficiently, integrating A.I. to offer personalized user experiences. This layer of personalization is what sets our application apart, making every interaction feel unique to each user. We chose Google Firebase for our database needs, ensuring that user data, authentication, and other critical processes are managed securely and effectively in real time.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the end, we pulled together impressively, using Git to build a full-stack application in just 36 hours, which included one all-nighter. It was surprising and rewarding to see how well our app worked, given that everyone on the team was trying new things and pushing their limits. This experience showed us what we can achieve together, learning and growing along the way. </p>
